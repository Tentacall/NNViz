# Neural Network Visualizer
# Overview
The Neural Network Visualizer is an open-source project designed to provide an intuitive and interactive 3D visualization of neural networks. Whether you're a beginner looking to understand the structure of a neural network or an experienced practitioner seeking insights into model behavior, this tool aims to make the exploration of neural networks more accessible.

### Objective:
- Create a 3d visulatization of a given neural network.
- Should be able to visualize the network in 3d space and it should be interactive.
- Option for loading a pre-trained model and visualize it
- Optimize for performance.
- Cross platform support.
